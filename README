README for rbl-milter 
---------------------

WARNING: This is an early release.  It probably has bugs.  

This is a simple sendmail milter which adds an X-RBL-Warning header to
any emails that are received that come from an open relay as determined
by your choice of RBL checking service (i.e. bl.spamcop.net).

If you have any questions, please contact Jeremy Beker
