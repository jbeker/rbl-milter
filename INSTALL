Prerquisites 
------------

You must have compiled sendmail with the milter support turned on.  This
can be done by adding the line

APPENDDEF(`conf_sendmail_ENVDEF', `-DMILTER')

To the 'devtools/Site/site.config.m4' file before compiling sendmail.

Install 
-------

1. run ./configure --with-sendmail=<sendmail source directory>

2. type 'make'

3. as root 'make install'

4. Edit your sendmail.mc to tell sendmail to run mail through the
milter. An example is:

INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`rbl-milter',`S=local:/var/run/rbl-milter')

REMEMBER the filename in the S= part, this is the socket your milter
will need to connect to.

5 Remake your sendmail.cf file.

6. Start up the milter as root.  It should fork into the background.

rbl-milter -p local:/var/run/rbl-milter -d inputs.orbz.org

7.  Restart sendmail.  Send yourself an email.  In your maillogs you
should see lines like the following:

sm-mta[2826]: g19CaLob002826: Milter (rbl-milter): init success to negotiate 
sm-mta[2826]: g19CaLob002826: Milter: connect to filters
sm-mta[2826]: g19CaLob002826: Milter accept: message

8. It should be working ;)
